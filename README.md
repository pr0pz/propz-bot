### __Instructions__

#### __Basics__
1. [Install Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/) on your Server/Computer

2. Go to the Bot folder and install all needed packages:
```sh
deno i
```
3. Rename the .env.example to .env
4. Inside the .env file you'll find instructions and URL's for every used service/website (most of them are optional).
4. The Bot uses puppeteer for local stuff and Discord welcome image. Puppeteer could cause some complications, check the troubleshooting stuff, already helped me getting it to work: https://pptr.dev/troubleshooting

#### __Running the Bot on a Server with a FQDN__
1. Don't forget to set the right BOT_URL inside your .env
2. Set the frontend root to frontend/public/
3. Setup an apache reverse proxy for the /websocket + /webhook + /api URL to work + secure /api and /websocket with your IP's (local, server, etc):
```apacheconf
<Location "/(api|websocket)">
	Require local
	Require ip 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8 9.0.1.2
</Location>

ProxyPass /websocket ws://localhost:1337/websocket
ProxyPassReverse /websocket ws://localhost:1337/websocket
ProxyPass /webhook http://localhost:1337/webhook
ProxyPassReverse /webhook http://localhost:1337/webhook
ProxyPass /api http://localhost:1337/api
ProxyPassReverse /api http://localhost:1337/api
```

#### __Configuration__
Check the bot/config folder
- discordEvents: for specific Discord events
- twitchEvents: for all kinds of events related to twitch (official twitch events and custom ones)
- twitchRewards: my twitch rewards. Only rewards created by the Bot can be manipulated by the Bot later on (like pause). Create your own rewards and leave reward ID blank, as it will be generated by Twitch and automaticaly saved back to the twitchRewards file
- twitchTimers: You can configure own automated messages that'll be send at minute X
- If you're using Discord: go to Discord.ts file and configure your guildId + channels and ID's

#### __Finally__

1. Build the Frontend
```sh
deno task build
````
2. Start the bot (probably on the server)
```sh
deno task bot
```
3. Start the local services (where OBS Studio is running)
```sh
deno task local
```
4. Embed frontend Routes as OBS browser sources as you like/need:
- "bot.domain.com/" : Alerts, Mediaboard, Raid Animation, EmoteEffects (rain, tornado), Ad Animation
- "bot.domain.com/chat": Stream Chat
- "bot.domain.com/events": Last Stream Events
- "bot.domain.com/focus": Focus Overlay
- "bot.domain.com/credits": Stream Credits
- "bot.domain.com/weather?cityName=Bielefeld&countryCode=de": Weather for the specified location

5. If everything is working fine, you can start the Bot with pm2 and it'll run forever and ever:
```sh
cd /to/the/folder/propz-bot/
pm2 start bot/index.ts \
	--interpreter='deno' \
	--interpreter-args='run -A --unstable-cron --env-file' \
	--name 'mySuperBotName'
```

#### __Folder Explanations__
Every Folder of the Bot has a separate purpose:
1. local-scripts: runs locally on your PC
- Connects the Bot to OBS
- Automatically mutes Spotify when an Ad is playing
- Prints shit on my Printer (only important for me)
2. frontend: Are embedded inside OBS as Browser Sources with different routes (URL's). The routes are listed above.
3. shared: Shared ressources across all folders
4. bot: Main Twitch Bot Magic connecting all services/websites
